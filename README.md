String calculator TDD exercise

You will implement a simple string calculator with TDD principles in mind. We will use a similar CI/CD process to last lecture.
https://codingdojo.org/kata/StringCalculator/

To get started:

1. One team member must fork this project.
2. Make sure you invite all your other teammates as collaborators
3. Enable Github issues, Go to the Settings page of your fork. Check the box next to Issues
4. Add at least 3 of the issues listed in the Kata, example: ## Newline as separator
   Allow the add method to handle newlines as separators:

<ul>
<li> "1\n2,3" should return "6". </li>
<li>"175.2,\n35" is invalid and should return the message "Number expected but '\n' found at position 6." </li>
</ul>

5. Start working on the issues, create a branch for each issue
6. Submit pull requests to merge into main on your fork. Make sure CI/CD tests are passing
